# WindowsWindowExtension
C++GodotGDExtension for interaction with Windows OS system windows.

Works with Godot 4.4 and 4.5 - for now. I am thinking about improving it later,
when I have more time and my main project Dotami-vrm (check on itch.io) needs it. 

Use if you need it. Check if you can learn something.
